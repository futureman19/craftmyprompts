  // --- Platform & Format ---
  "TikTok": "Critical Rule: Hook must happen in 0.5 seconds; visual movement or text overlay immediately. Hidden Mechanic: Audio is a search engine; using 'Trending Sounds' (even at 0% volume) boosts algorithmic discovery. Common Pitfall: Corporate polish; TikTok rewards lo-fi, authentic, shot-on-phone aesthetics over studio quality.",
  "Instagram Reels": "Critical Rule: Do not leave the TikTok watermark; the algorithm suppresses recycled content. Hidden Mechanic: Aesthetic covers matter; unlike TikTok, Reels sit on your permanent grid, so the thumbnail must match your brand vibe. Common Pitfall: Text outside the 'Safe Zone'; UI elements cover the bottom 20% and right side.",
  "YouTube Shorts": "Critical Rule: Loop your video seamlessly; the end should flow back into the beginning to trick users into watching twice. Hidden Mechanic: Shorts are the primary funnel for long-form subscribers; pin a related video in the comments. Common Pitfall: Treating it like a story; Shorts are evergreen search content, not just daily updates.",
  "YouTube Video": "Critical Rule: CTR (Click Through Rate) + AVD (Average View Duration) = Success. Your thumbnail and title are 50% of the work. Hidden Mechanic: The 'J-Cut' (audio starts before video) keeps viewers engaged during transitions. Common Pitfall: Long intros; start the content immediately. No 'Hey guys, welcome back'.",
  
  // --- Viral Mechanics ---
  "Short-Form Viral Hooks": "Critical Rule: The hook must be delivered in under 3 seconds; if the viewer does not pause within 0.4 seconds, the algorithm marks the video as a failure. Hidden Mechanic: The 'Visual Pattern Interrupt'; visuals must change every 1.5 seconds during the hook to break the brain's prediction error mechanism. Common Pitfall: Starting with 'Hey guys' or 'Welcome back,' which triggers an immediate scroll reflex; start In Media Res (middle of the action) instead.",
  "YouTube Title Engineering": "Critical Rule: Adhere to specific syntactic structures like 'I Tested [Number] Years Of [Subject]' or 'Don't Buy [Product] Until You Watch This' to trigger psychological levers like Time Arbitrage or Risk Mitigation. Hidden Mechanic: The 'Time Condenser' effect; titles promising to compress years of experience into minutes signal high information density to the algorithm. Common Pitfall: Writing purely descriptive titles (e.g., 'Review of the iPhone 15') instead of conflict-driven titles.",
  "Retention Editing Physics": "Critical Rule: Remove all breaths and pauses longer than 0.2 seconds (The 'Millennial Pause' removal) to maintain information density. Hidden Mechanic: Use 'J-Cuts' where the audio from the next clip starts before the video cuts to it, bridging the cognitive gap and smoothing the transition. Common Pitfall: 'Pacing Drag,' where visual information density falls below the brain's processing speed; a visual change (zoom, text, cut) must occur every 2-5 seconds.",
  "The Loop Mechanism": "Critical Rule: The final sentence of the script must syntactically flow back into the opening hook to encourage immediate re-watching. Hidden Mechanic: This technique tricks the algorithm into registering >100% Average Percentage Viewed (APV), which is the strongest signal for viral distribution. Common Pitfall: Using a definitive sign-off like 'Thanks for watching' which signals the viewer to scroll away.",

  // --- Generation Physics (Runway/Pika) ---
  "Runway Gen-2 Camera Control": "Critical Rule: Distinctly separate 'Motion Brush' (which moves the subject) from 'Camera Motion' (which moves the viewport). Hidden Mechanic: Create 'Parallax' by assigning opposite motion vectors; for example, panning the camera right (`Horizontal +2`) while the subject moves left via Motion Brush (`Horizontal -3`). Common Pitfall: Setting motion values to the maximum (10), which causes significant warping and distortion; values between 3-5 are optimal for realism.",
  "AI Video Physics Simulation": "Critical Rule: Explicitly describe weight and impact to counter the 'floating' tendency of diffusion models (e.g., 'The ball accelerates downwards at 9.8m/s^2 and deforms upon impact'). Hidden Mechanic: 'Visual Anchoring'; repeating specific descriptive traits (e.g., 'Red scarf') in every segment of a prompt chain helps maintain object permanence across frames. Common Pitfall: Using generic motion terms like 'moving'; use specific cinematic terms like 'Truck', 'Pan', or 'Dolly Zoom' to define the physics of the camera.",

  // --- Camera Movement ---
  "Pan Left/Right": "Critical Rule: Smooth, constant speed. Hidden Mechanic: Reveals new information horizontally; use it to show the relationship between two objects. Common Pitfall: 'Hose-piping' (panning back and forth aimlessly); pick a direction and commit.",
  "Tilt Up/Down": "Critical Rule: Vertical reveal. Hidden Mechanic: Tilt Up = Revealing scale/grandeur (hero). Tilt Down = Revealing ground/defeat. Common Pitfall: Tilting too fast causes motion strobing.",
  "Zoom In/Out": "Critical Rule: Zooming changes the focal length (background compression), not just the size. Hidden Mechanic: 'Crash Zoom' adds comedic or dramatic emphasis instantly. Common Pitfall: Digital zoom; always optical zoom if possible to preserve resolution.",
  "Rack Focus": "Critical Rule: Shifting focus from foreground to background. Hidden Mechanic: Directs the viewer's eye to the most important element. Common Pitfall: 'Hunting'; missing the focus point and adjusting back and forth.",
  "Handheld Shake": "Critical Rule: Adds realism and urgency. Hidden Mechanic: High shutter speed increases the perceived chaos of the shake (Private Ryan effect). Common Pitfall: Rolling shutter; cheap sensors turn handheld footage into Jell-O.",
  "Drone Flyover": "Critical Rule: Constant velocity and altitude. Hidden Mechanic: Reveals geography and scale. Common Pitfall: Propellers in shot; flying too fast forward angles the camera down into the props.",
  "FPV Drone": "Critical Rule: Acrobatic, high-speed flight. Hidden Mechanic: Needs a high refresh rate to watch comfortably. Common Pitfall: Motion sickness; keep the horizon somewhat understandable.",
  "Orbit": "Critical Rule: Circling a subject while keeping them centered. Hidden Mechanic: Isolate the hero; the background spins, making the subject the only stable thing. Common Pitfall: Jerky movement; requires high skill or automation.",
  "Tracking Shot": "Critical Rule: Camera follows the subject at the same speed. Hidden Mechanic: Places the viewer 'with' the character. Common Pitfall: Losing the lead room; keep space in front of the subject.",

  // --- Environmental Physics ---
  "Zero Gravity": "Critical Rule: Objects float with inertia; they don't stop unless they hit something. Hidden Mechanic: Liquids form spheres due to surface tension. Common Pitfall: Things falling; there is no 'down'.",
  "Underwater Physics": "Critical Rule: Drag/Resistance; movement is slow and deliberate. Hidden Mechanic: Light refraction and caustics; things look 33% larger. Common Pitfall: Clear vision; water creates blue haze and blur over distance.",
  "Slow Motion Fluid": "Critical Rule: High frame rate (60fps+) played back at 24fps. Hidden Mechanic: Reveals viscosity and surface tension invisible to the eye. Common Pitfall: Optical Flow interpolation artifacts if forcing standard footage to slow mo."
