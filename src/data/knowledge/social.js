  "X (Twitter)": {
    "rule": "Hook the reader in the first 5 words.",
    "mechanic": "Threads ('🧵') perform better than external links; the algorithm penalizes users leaving the app.",
    "pitfall": "Using too many hashtags; 1-2 is optimal. Structure: 1. The Hook (Promise), 2. The Context, 3. The Meat, 4. The CTA."
  },
  "LinkedIn": {
    "rule": "Use 'Broetry' formatting (one sentence per line) to maximize mobile readability and dwell time.",
    "mechanic": "Comments drive reach 2x more than likes; end your post with a specific question to spark debate.",
    "pitfall": "Adding external links in the post body (it kills reach); put them in the comments or use 'Link in Bio'."
  },
  "Medium": {
    "rule": "Headlines are 80% of the success; use the 'Curiosity Gap' technique.",
    "mechanic": "Interaction (claps/highlights) helps internal distribution.",
    "pitfall": "Posting generic blog content; the algorithm favors niche authority and personal stories."
  },
  "Reddit": {
    "rule": "Add value before extracting value; 'Self-promotion' is punished by downvotes.",
    "mechanic": "Each subreddit has a unique 'Hivemind'; mimic the linguistic norms of the target r/.",

    "mechanic": "The algorithm favors replies and thread depth over standalone likes.",
    "pitfall": "Reposting Instagram content; native text performs significantly better."
  },
  "Cold Email": {
    "rule": "Subject lines must look internal (e.g., 'question about [company]') to bypass spam filters.",
    "mechanic": "The 'PS' line is the second most read part of the email.",
    "pitfall": "Asking for time ('30 mins'); ask for interest ('worth a chat?')."

  // --- Content Type ---
  "Carousel (PDF/Image)": {
    "rule": "The 'Slide Logic' must be linear. Slide 1: The Hook (Big Typography). Slide 2: Retention (The secondary hook). Slides 3-8: Value. Slide 9: Summary. Slide 10: CTA.",
    "mechanic": "Panoramic backgrounds encouraging swiping increase engagement."
  },
  "Thread": {
    "rule": "The first tweet is the ad for the rest of the thread. It must contain Social Proof ('How I...') and a Benefit ('...to get X').",
    "mechanic": "The last tweet must link back to the first tweet (RT yourself) to create a viral loop."

  "Case Study": {
    "rule": "Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).",

  "Shareability (Viral)": {
    "rule": "Content must be an 'Identity Signal'; people share things to look smart, funny, or virtuous.",

  "Dwell Time (Long Read)": {
    "rule": "The hook must promise a specific payoff.",
    "mechanic": "Use 'Bucket Brigades' (colons, short transition phrases like 'Here's the deal:') to keep the eye moving down the page."
  },

  // --- Hook Strategy ---
  "Negativity Bias": {
    "rule": "Frame the benefit as avoiding pain. Syntax: 'Stop [Action] if you want [Goal]'. Humans are 2x more motivated to avoid loss than gain."
  },
  "Curiosity Gap": {
    "rule": "Reveal WHAT happened but not WHY in the headline. Syntax: 'You won't believe what happens when...'. Creates a psychological itch that must be scratched."
  },
  "Unpopular Opinion": {
    "rule": "The opinion must be defensible, not just random.",
    "mechanic": "Validates the 'Silent Majority' who agree but are afraid to speak up. Syntax: 'Everyone thinks X, but actually Y.'"
  },
  "Pattern Interrupt": {
    "rule": "Break the visual habit immediately. Use all caps or a strange character (e.g., [ALERT]).",
    "pitfall": "Overuse leads to banner blindness."

  // --- Structure ---
  "Copywriting": {
    "rule": "Every sentence has one job: get the next sentence read.",
    "mechanic": "Vary sentence length (Short. Short. Long. Short) to create rhythm."
  },
  "Storytelling": {
    "rule": "Establish stakes early. If we don't know what is lost if they fail, we don't care.",
    "mechanic": "Show, Don't Tell."
  },
